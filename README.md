# BSQ
The program find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.
The board can be generated two ways. The first one is by reading a file passed as the programâ€™s argument and the second one generating it

The second way to obtain a board is to generate one based on given parameters. The parameters will be a number, representing the width and height of the board, and a pattern that will be repeated line by line along the board.
You will print the solved board.

(If ever there are several solutions, you have to represent only the highest square. If they are still several solutions, choose the square to the left.)
